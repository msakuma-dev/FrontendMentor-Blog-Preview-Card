## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I spent a lot more time to understand the design in the Figma files to get the text sizing correct.
I'm proud that I was able to understand how rem, em units work for font-sizes and how the padding and margins are at the proper size.

I also spent a good amount of time to make sure the media-queries are correct and the image resizes the way it's supposed to be.

### Continued development

I still want to understand how to apply the OG Meta Data correctly for these mini projects and make sure things are responsive the way I intend it to be.

### Useful resources

- [Control your images](https://youtu.be/6yAAV-uP0po?si=yLR3GglnMUsZWj-y) - This helped me to fit the image properly within the card. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
